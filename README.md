This project is about makin a website that is a clone of the AirBnB website.

It consists of two parts, the console and the backend.
The backend is where the data storage happens and it is dome by JSON serialization and deserialization.
The console is a basic Cmd consloe (like the unix shell) where you can create new objects, delete them or show info about existing ones.
